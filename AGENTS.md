Keep things stupid simple - KISS

Keep things fast, don't add frameworks or dependencies unless it's absolutely worth it.

Don't use emojis.

Prefer usability over design. Prefer design language from earlier when the big tech companies had big UX teams who actually made things usable. Don't make it retro looking for the sake of it, only for usability.

Test when you can easily. If you run anything, make sure you have timeouts to avoid getting stuck.
